Part A
The Talk-A-Lot Cell Phone Company provides phone services for its customers. Create an abstract class named PhoneCall that includes a String field for a phone number (phoneNumber) and a double field for the price (price) of the call.

Include a constructor that requires a phone number parameter and that sets the price to 0.0.

Include a set method for the price. Also include three abstract get methods—one that returns the phoneNumber, another that returns the price of the call, and a third that displays information about the call.

Part B
Create two child classes of PhoneCall: IncomingPhoneCall and OutgoingPhoneCall. The IncomingPhoneCall constructor passes its phone number parameter to its parent’s constructor and sets the price of the call to 2 cents. The method that displays the phone call information displays the phone number, the rate, and the price of the call (which is the same as the rate).

The OutgoingPhoneCall class constructor includes an additional field that holds the time (time) of the call in minutes. The constructor requires both a phone number and the time. The price is 4 cents per minute, and the display method shows the details of the call, including the phone number, the rate per minute, the number of minutes, and the total price.

Part C
Write an application called DemoPhoneCalls in which you declare a PhoneCall reference. Then continually prompt the user for a type of call, (I)ncoming or (O)utgoing until the sentinel value Q is entered. Create either an IncomingPhoneCall object or an OutgoingPhoneCall object and assign it to the PhoneCall reference. Then display the data for the object.

An example of the program is shown below:

Is this call (I)ncoming or (O)utgoing?
Or enter Q to quit >> I
Enter the phone number >> 1-234-567-8901
Incoming phone call 1-234-567-8901 0.02 per call. Total is $0.02

Is this call (I)ncoming or (O)utgoing?
Or enter Q to quit >> O
Enter the phone number >> 1-098-765-4321
Enter minutes >> 23
Outgoing phone call 1-098-765-4321 0.04 per minute at 23 minutes. Total is $0.92

Is this call (I)ncoming or (O)utgoing?
Or enter Q to quit >> Q
