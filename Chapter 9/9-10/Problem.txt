Part A
Create an abstract Division class with fields for a companyâ€™s division name (divisionTitle) and account number (acctNum), and an abstract display() method. Use a constructor in the superclass that requires values for both fields.

Part B
Create two subclasses named InternationalDivision and DomesticDivision.

The InternationalDivision subclass includes a field for the country in which the division is located (country) and a field for the language spoken (language); its constructor requires both.

The DomesticDivision subclass includes a field for the state in which the division is located (state); a value for this field is required by the constructor.

Part C
Write an application named UseDivision that creates a Division reference. Ask the user whether a (D) for a DomesticDivision or (I) for an InternationalDivision object should be created. Prompt for appropriate values and assign a new subclass object to the Division reference. Then display the details of the created object.

An example of the program is shown below:

Is this for a (D)omestic or (I)nternational division? >> D
Enter division name >> Division 9
Enter acct number >> 32147889
Enter state >> Iowa
Domestic Division: Division Division 9 Acct# 32147889
Located in Iowa
