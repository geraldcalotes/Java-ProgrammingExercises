Part A
The mean of a list of numbers is its arithmetic average. The median of a list is its middle value when the values are placed in order. For example, if an ordered list contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12, then the mean is 6, and their median is 5.

Write an application called MeanMedian that allows you to enter nine integers and displays the values, their mean, and their median.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter number 1 >> 179
Enter number 2 >> 32
Enter number 3 >> 187
Enter number 4 >> 102
Enter number 5 >> 94
Enter number 6 >> 87
Enter number 7 >> 86
Enter number 8 >> 107
Enter number 9 >> 161
You entered: 179,  32,  187,  102,  94,  87,  86,  107,  161
The mean is 115.0 and the median is 102
Part B
Copy the code from the MeanMedian.java file into the MeanMedian2.java file and revise the MeanMedian class so that the user can enter any number of values until 9999 or 20 values have been entered. If the list has an even number of values, the median is the numeric average of the values in the two middle positions. Rename the class MeanMedian2.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter number 1 or 9999 to quit >> 190
Enter number 2 or 9999 to quit >> 76
Enter number 3 or 9999 to quit >> 82
Enter number 4 or 9999 to quit >> 185
Enter number 5 or 9999 to quit >> 145
Enter number 6 or 9999 to quit >> 97
Enter number 7 or 9999 to quit >> 178
Enter number 8 or 9999 to quit >> 81
Enter number 9 or 9999 to quit >> 9999
size is 8
You entered: 190,  76,  82,  185,  145,  97,  178,  81
The mean is 129.25 and the median is 121.0
