Write an application called BirthdayReminder that allows a user to enter the names and birthdates of up to 10 friends. Continue to prompt the user for names and birthdates until the user enters the sentinel value ZZZ for a name or has entered 10 names, whichever comes first. When the user is finished entering names, produce a count of how many names were entered, and then display the names. In a loop, continually ask the user to type one of the names and display the corresponding birthdate. If there is no corresponding birthdate, display the error message "Sorry, no entry for x" where "x" is the name not been previously entered. The loop continues until the user enters ZZZ for a name.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter a name >> Noelia 
Enter birthdate with slashes between the month, day, and year >> 4/4/1979
Enter a name or ZZZ to quit >> Rodger
Enter birthdate with slashes between the month, day, and year >> 6/30/1980
Enter a name or ZZZ to quit >> Giovanni
Enter birthdate with slashes between the month, day, and year >> 11/16/1986
Enter a name or ZZZ to quit >> ZZZ

Count of names entered: 3
Noelia 
Rodger
Giovanni

Enter a name to search for or ZZZ to quit >> Rodger
Rodger's birthdate is 6/30/1980
Enter a name to search for or ZZZ to quit >> ZZZ
info> Your program should accept dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
