Write an application called Palindrome that determines whether a phrase entered by the user is a palindrome. A palindrome is a phrase that reads the same backward and forward without regarding capitalization or punctuation. For example, "Dot saw I was Tod", "Was it a car or a cat I saw", and "Madam, Iâ€™m Adam" are palindromes.

If the phrase is a palindrome, display the message: Yes, you entered a palindrome. If the phrase is not a palindrome display the message: No, you did not enter a palindrome.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter a string >> racecar
Yes, you entered a palindrome
