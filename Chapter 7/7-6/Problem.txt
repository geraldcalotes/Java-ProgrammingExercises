Part A
Write an application called Alphabetize that accepts three Strings from the user and, without regard to case, appropriately displays a message that indicates whether the Strings were entered in alphabetical order. If the entered values are in alphabetical order, start the message with Yes, otherwise start the message with No.

Some examples of the program are shown below:

Enter first string >> Mars
Enter second string >> Earth
Enter third string >> Jupiter
No, the strings entered are not in alphabetical order
Enter first string >> Earth
Enter second string >> Jupiter
Enter third string >> Mars
Yes, the strings entered are in alphabetical order
Part B
Copy the code from the Alphabetize file into the Alphabetize2 file and modify the application so that it accepts three Strings from the user and displays them in alphabetical order without regard to case. Rename the class to Alphabetize2.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter first string >> bear
Enter second string >> Apple
Enter third string >> Cat
Apple bear Cat
