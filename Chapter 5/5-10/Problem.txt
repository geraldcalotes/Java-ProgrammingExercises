Use the Web to locate the lyrics to the traditional song “The Twelve Days of Christmas.” The song contains a list of gifts received for the holiday. The list is cumulative so that as each “day” passes, a new verse contains all the words of the previous verse, plus a new item. Write an application called TwelveDays that displays the words to the song starting with any day the user enters.

info> Hint: Use a switch statement with cases in descending day order and without any break statements so that the lyrics for any day repeat all the lyrics for previous days.
