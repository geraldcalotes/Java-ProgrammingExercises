Create a class named Purchase. Each Purchase contains an invoice number (invoiceNumber), amount of sale (saleAmount), and amount of sales tax (tax). Include set and get methods for the invoice number and sale amount. Within the set method for the sale amount, calculate the sales tax as 5 percent of the sale amount. Also include a display method that displays a purchase’s details.

Next, create an application called CreatePurchase that declares a Purchase object and prompts the user for purchase details. When you prompt for an invoice number, do not let the user proceed until a number between 1,000 and 8,000 inclusive has been entered. When you prompt for a sale amount, do not proceed until the user has entered a nonnegative value. After a valid Purchase object has been created, display the object’s invoice number, sale amount, and sales tax.

An example of the code is shown below:

Enter invoice number >> 2385
Enter sale amount >> 4081.28
Invoice #2385  Amount of sale: $4081.28  Tax: $204.06400000000002
